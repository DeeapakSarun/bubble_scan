## **Code Quality and Best Practices**

1. **Code Style:**

   - Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent JavaScript/React formatting.

3. **Testing:**
   - Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
   - Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a PR.

   - Example format: `Fix issue with file upload not accepting PDF`, `Add unit tests for custom sheet processing`, etc.
