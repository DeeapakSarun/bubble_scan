### Agenda

We are meeting with our client to recieve feedback on the current state of the project, and deliberate on how future improvements may be implemented. We would like to bring up the concept of custom formatted answers as well, and discuss what this might look like in Bubble Scan. 

### Action Items

**We would like to take Bubble Scan public so that it may be utilized by those whom it would prove useful for. Some interface work might be pertinent here as people unfamiliar with this kind of software might be using it. According to our client, aesthetics are not a priority but they can be worked on. Furthermore, we are looking towards the development of custom Scantron sheets, ones that may be printed by anyone, anywhere. This would help lower the cost of testing, and make accessing grading materials a lot easier.**

1. C.S. team
    - focus on getting the software ready to go public
    - maybe improve the UI if there is time, but this isn't a top priority
    - think about creating a custom sheet that Bubble Scan could process alternatively to Scantron


### Additional Notes
- Dr. Woods brought up his current grading system, Gradescope, as a source of inspiration for the categorization/organization of student information/data with Bubble Scan
- The parallels we would like to see have to do with grading software that has yet to be implemented, but we can look to Gradescope as an example of an efficient system
- We'd like to test the accuracy of printing custom sheets, if the frame is askew on the printed paper, will the software still be able to process accurately?
